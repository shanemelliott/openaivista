# VA OpenAI Demo

This repository contains a demo for using OpenAI's API to analyze VistA EMR data. It also uses [vista-api-x](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/octo-vista-api-x) to fetch data from a VistA using the [VPR GET PATIENT DATA JSON](https://vivian.worldvista.org/vivian-data/8994/8994-3243.html).

The goal of this demo is to demonstrate how to use OpenAI's API to analyze patient data and generate summaries.

You can view an example of analysis results in the [output.txt](./output.txt) file.
